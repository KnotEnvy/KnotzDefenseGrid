Excellent! It's definitely a great time to pause, take stock, and update our planning documents. Building software is an iterative process, and keeping the requirements and roadmap aligned with progress is key.

## Project Recap: Sentinel Grid (Pygame Edition) - End of Phase 3

**Current Status:** We have successfully implemented the foundational mechanics for a playable 2D tower defense game core loop using Python and Pygame.

**Key Functionalities Achieved:**

1.  **Core Engine Setup:** Basic Pygame window, main game loop, delta time calculation, and event handling are operational.
2.  **Data-Driven Design:** Game entities (Towers, Enemies, Waves, Levels) are defined primarily in external JSON files, allowing for easier configuration and expansion. Robust file path handling is implemented.
3.  **Modular Architecture:** Code is organized into distinct classes and modules (`GameManager`, `ResourceManager`, `UIManager`, `WaveManager`, `TowerManager`, `Enemy`, `Tower`, `Projectile`, `TowerPlatform`, `config`) promoting separation of concerns.
4.  **Resource Management:** A system tracks player resources, allows spending (for towers), and handles gaining resources upon enemy destruction.
5.  **Enemy Spawning & Pathfinding:** The `WaveManager` reads wave data, spawns enemies from a basic object pool according to timed sequences, and enemies successfully navigate a predefined path using waypoints.
6.  **Tower Placement:** Players can select different tower types (via keyboard input), see a placement preview (visualizing range and placement validity), and place towers on designated `TowerPlatform` sprites by clicking, deducting the resource cost.
7.  **Tower Combat:** Placed towers automatically target the nearest enemy within range, adhere to a fire rate cooldown, and fire projectiles.
8.  **Projectile System:** A `ProjectilePool` manages projectile instances, which travel towards their target's initial position and are removed upon collision or lifetime expiration.
9.  **Combat Resolution:** Collision detection between projectiles and enemies is implemented. Enemies have health, take damage upon being hit, and are removed from the game (returning to their pool) when health reaches zero, granting resources.
10. **Basic Visuals & UI:** Simple shapes drawn with Pygame represent entities. A basic HUD displays resource count, placeholder wave info, and placeholder core health. Health bars are drawn above damaged enemies.

**Current Limitations / Next Steps Focus:**

*   No central "Core" objective for enemies to attack.
*   No Win/Loss conditions tied to gameplay state.
*   Wave progression isn't clearly tracked or displayed beyond console messages.
*   No tower upgrade mechanism.
*   Sound and advanced visual effects are absent.
*   UI is minimal (no menus, limited feedback).
*   Passive resource generation isn't active.

## Updated Software Architecture Development Document (SADD) - Project: Sentinel Grid (Pygame Edition)

*(Reflects current implementation state and immediate next steps focus)*

**1. Introduction** - *Unchanged*
**2. System Overview** - *Unchanged*
**3. Architectural Goals** - *Unchanged*
**4. Key Architectural Patterns & Concepts** - *Unchanged (Pooling implemented simply)*

**5. Core Modules / Components (Status Update)**

*   **`main.py`:** (Implemented) Initializes Pygame, managers, main loop, basic input delegation.
*   **`game_manager.py` (Class: `GameManager`):** (Partially Implemented) Manages basic `PLAYING`/`PAUSED` state. *Needs Core tracking, Win/Loss condition logic, and state transitions.*
*   **`input_handler.py` (Integrated into `main.py`):** (Implemented) Handles quit, pause, tower selection (keys), placement (mouse click).
*   **`ui_manager.py` (Class: `UIManager`):** (Partially Implemented) Draws basic HUD (Resources, placeholders for Wave/Core). *Needs accurate Wave/Core display, menus (Pause, GameOver, Victory), selected tower info.*
*   **`resource_manager.py` (Class: `ResourceManager`):** (Partially Implemented) Tracks resources, handles spending/gaining. *Needs passive generation implementation.*
*   **`tower_manager.py` (Class: `TowerManager`):** (Implemented) Handles tower selection, preview, placement validation, cost deduction, projectile pool access. Contains `ProjectilePool`.
*   **`tower_platform.py` (Class: `TowerPlatform(pygame.sprite.Sprite)`):** (Implemented) Represents placeable areas, tracks occupation status.
*   **`towers.py` (Base Class: `Tower(pygame.sprite.Sprite)`):** (Implemented) Base class logic (targeting, firing). `GunTower`, `CannonTower` subclasses implemented. *Needs upgrade logic hooks.*
*   **`wave_manager.py` (Class: `WaveManager`):** (Implemented) Loads wave/enemy data, handles timed spawning using simple enemy pool, tracks active wave status. *Needs hooks for GameManager to query wave completion status.*
*   **`enemies.py` (Base Class: `Enemy(pygame.sprite.Sprite)`):** (Partially Implemented) Handles movement, health, damage taking, death reward. *Needs interaction logic for reaching the Core.* Contains simple health bar drawing. Enemy pool implemented in `WaveManager`.
*   **`path.py` (Defined in `config.py`):** (Implemented) Path defined by list of coordinates.
*   **`core.py` (Class: `Core(pygame.sprite.Sprite)`):** (**Not Implemented**) *Crucial component for Phase 4.*
*   **`projectiles.py` (Class: `Projectile(pygame.sprite.Sprite)`):** (Implemented) Handles movement, damage payload, collision handling (via `main.py`), lifetime. Pooling implemented in `TowerManager`.
*   **`audio_manager.py` (Class: `AudioManager`):** (**Not Implemented**) *Planned for Phase 5.*
*   **`config_loader.py` (Utility Functions in Managers):** (Implemented) Managers load their respective JSON data using absolute paths.

**6. Data Structures (JSON Files)** - *Implemented and in use*
    *   `data/towers.json`
    *   `data/enemies.json`
    *   `data/waves.json`
    *   `data/levels.json`

**7. Key Interactions Flow (Status Update)** - The core loop described previously (spawn -> move -> place -> target -> fire -> collide -> damage -> die/reward) is functional. *Missing the 'Enemy Reaches End' interaction with the Core and the subsequent Win/Loss checks.*
